# SafePass
SafePass is a highly secure password generator that utilizes a diceware-style algorithm to generate passphrases that are both secure and easy to remember. The diceware algorithm is based on the principle that truly random words are difficult to guess or predict, making them ideal for use in passwords. 

The diceware algorithm works by generating a sequence of random words from a list of 7,776 words. Each word in the list is assigned a unique five-digit number, which is generated using a set of five dice. By rolling the dice five times and matching the resulting numbers to the corresponding words in the list, a truly random word can be generated.

SafePass has further enhanced the security of the diceware-style algorithm by including additional features such as the option to include numbers and special characters in the passphrase, as well as an option to include spaces between words. These additional features make the generated passphrases more complex and resistant to brute-force attacks.

In addition to the diceware-style algorithm, SafePass also includes a password strength meter that provides feedback on the strength of the generated password. The strength meter uses a combination of factors, including password length, complexity, and entropy, to provide an accurate assessment of the password's strength.
